**Flight Delay Prediction Project**

**Project Overview**

This project predicts flight delays using historical flight and weather data. The focus is on building a machine learning model that incorporates probabilistic techniques such as Bayesian methods or Monte Carlo simulations to account for uncertainty caused by weather conditions.

**Key Features**

Data Processing: Handling historical weather and flight data, cleaning, and preprocessing for modeling.
Machine Learning Model: Training predictive models to estimate flight delays.
Uncertainty Quantification: Employing probabilistic approaches to capture the effects of weather variability on predictions.
Visualization: Generating plots to explain model performance and uncertainty effects.
Report Generation: Documenting findings, including potential improvements and key insights.
